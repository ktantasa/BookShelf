This is an implementation of a program to interact with a bookshelf-keeper, that maintains a shelf of books in increasing order by height. The program enables users to perform a series of put and pick operations via a BookshelfKeeper object that youâ€™ll implement. The pick operation refers to a case where you need to pick a book from a given position (index), and the put operation refers to putting a book of given height on the shelf, such that the bookshelf remains sorted after completing any operation.  The only information you store about a book is its height.
